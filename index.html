            <p>

                Hello! I'm <span class="developer-word">Rafael Branco</span>, a dedicated <strong>QA Engineer</strong>
                with a strong focus on delivering high-quality
                software solutions through comprehensive testing and automation. With expertise in tools like Selenium,
                Playwright, and WebDriverIO, and a solid foundation in Python, JavaScript, and various testing
                methodologies, I excel in ensuring seamless software performance. While my primary passion lies in QA, I
                also bring software engineering experience, allowing me to bridge the gap between development and
                testing. I thrive in Agile environments, committed to enhancing software quality and user satisfaction
                through meticulous test planning and execution.
